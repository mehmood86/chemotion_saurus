Either the data is actively transferred via a client application from the local computer/server to the  Chemotion ELN server or the  Chemotion ELN server directly accesses the device data storage folder. The first solution requires more efforts for the installation and maintenance of several client applications, therefore, we followed a central solution (Figure 3A) where both, the device computer and the  Chemotion ELN server, have access to a common storage. Considering the availability of transfer software packages for the server and for the device computers, we focused on SFTP over NFS, CIFS/SAMBA, FTPS to securely transfer files. SFTP is relatively well supported and free third-party software and can be found even for legacy operation systems (OS) such as windows XP. Though the latter OS supports mapping of the network drive, the obsolete and unsafe SMBv1 protocol cannot be accepted. Having such an OS in a network is nowadays a high security issue.

It is critical for this mode to know if the measurements have been completed and all files have been written. This can be achieved by defining the number of files that have to be present within a data folder for a completed measurement.
